# GitRoast 🔥

> **Warning:** This application is designed to cause emotional damage. Proceed at your own risk.

**GitRoast** is a brutal, AI-powered web application that analyzes your GitHub profile, dissects your code quality (or lack thereof), and delivers a scathing roast using Google's Gemini AI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Deep Profile Analysis**: Fetches your public GitHub profile and analyzes your recent repository activity.
- **AI Roasting Engine**: Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to generate unique, witty, and harsh critiques based on your actual tech stack, commit history, and generic bio.
- **Cooked Level**: Calculates a roast score (0-100%) to determine just how bad your profile really is.
- **Dynamic Titles**: Awards you with appropriate titles like "Spaghetti Chef", "Console.log Debugger", or "Fork Master".
- **Cyberpunk UI**: A dark, terminal-inspired interface featuring Tailwind CSS animations and a hacker aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Dark Mode)
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini (`@google/genai`)
- **Data Source**: GitHub REST API
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one for free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitroast.git
   cd gitroast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or set the environment variable in your runner) containing your Gemini API Key.
   
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

   > **Note:** The application expects `process.env.API_KEY` to be available. Ensure your build tool (Vite, Webpack, Parcel, etc.) supports environment variable injection.

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter a GitHub username (e.g., `torvalds` or your own).
3. Click the **ROAST 🔥** button.
4. Wait for the analysis steps:
   - *Accessing GitHub Mainframe...*
   - *Scanning repositories...*
   - *Igniting Gemini Neural Networks...*
5. Read your roast and try not to take it personally.
